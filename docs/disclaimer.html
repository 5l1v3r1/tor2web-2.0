You are ready to view some page served by the anonymous network <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a>.<br>
These pages exists because is possibile setup anonymous service, and you are trying to reach this service with your browser.<br><br>
While navigating in these page, you need to remember some relevant facts that differs since common Internet navigation:<br><br>
<b>1.</b> Tor2web service works like a "proxy service", therfore the contents served by Tor2web don't exist phisically in the server.<br>
<b>2.</b> The Administrator of Tor2web will not preemptively deny the publishing of any kind of contents, everyone is able to setup an <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">hidden service</a>.
<b>3.</b> Access to an anonymous and censor resistant network like Tor, with tor2web, downgrade the hi level security provided by the network in a less safe internet navigation. This software is thinked to make an user without Tor, able to access at a Tor only contents. Anyway, is far better if you download a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en">Tor bundle</a> could make you able to reach the hidden service with easy and more security.<br>
<b>4.</b> You should belive that a content is totally unhetical and not conform to the current laws. We can't do anything, in fact, the content will remain in the Tor network. anyway, because a Tor2web proxy is not anonymous and runned by some civilian users, you could signal that page (specifing a reason) because you belive the contents is better to do not serve. <b>also in this way</b> Tor2web use a continuos rounding of the Tor2wev proxies, therfore, if a node has actually deny the access to your signaled website, maybe another tor2web don't do that filter.<br>
